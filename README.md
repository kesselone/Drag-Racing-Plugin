# Drag-Racing-Plugin
Drag Racing Plugin for YourDyno.com

This plugin uses some of the functionallities of Speed and distance plugin and combines it with the relay board plugin. It can simulate drag racing, control the so called christmas tree (the starting light) and measure the time.

Current race modes are:
1/8mi
1/4mi
1/2mi
0-100kph
0-200kph

It is easy to come up with new modes. Perhaps at a later stage this should be user configurable.
